# 🏊‍♂️ 1337 Pool Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I've documented all the projects I completed during the **1337 Pool** two years ago. This was my first experience with coding, marking the beginning of my journey into the world of programming, specifically using the **C language**.

## 🌍 About the 1337 Pool

The **1337 Pool** is an intense, month-long coding bootcamp that serves as the entrance exam for [1337](https://1337.ma/), an innovative coding school in Morocco. Inspired by the École 42 model, the Pool is designed to test participants' resilience, problem-solving skills, and ability to learn quickly. During this period, we were introduced to fundamental programming concepts and worked on various challenging projects, all using the **C programming language**.

This project is a programming bootcamp concerning **1337 School**, lasting roughly 4 weeks, working 7 days a week, day and night. *(Error 404: sleep will never be found)*. The bootcamp covers the basics of programming, so there’s no need to have any prior experience. People will try and fail, over and over again. This trial-and-error process is necessary to find solutions to problems that once seemed impossible. We learn in groups with other students, without teachers. It’s tough, but it works.

**"If you're going through hell, keep going."**

Keep this in mind!

## 💡 Skills Developed During the Pool

### Hard Skills

#### 🔹 C Language
The primary language learned during the 1337 Pool is **C**. We worked on variables, pointers, memory management, functions, and creating libraries. Projects ranged from simple programs to complex algorithms, teaching us how to code efficiently.

#### 🔹 Shell Scripting
At the beginning of the Pool, we were introduced to **Shell commands** and scripting. This allowed us to automate tasks, navigate the terminal with ease, and gain a deeper understanding of system-level operations.

#### 🔹 Git Version Control
All projects were submitted using **Git**, a vital skill for any developer. This forced us to learn how to manage repositories, track changes, and collaborate with peers through version control systems.

### Soft Skills

#### 🔸 Self-Learning and Adaptability
With no teachers around, we had to rely on ourselves and our peers to find solutions. We learned how to search for information effectively, ask the right questions, and troubleshoot issues independently—a skill critical for any software developer.

#### 🔸 Teamwork
We regularly participated in **team projects** called "Rushes," where random groups of students collaborated to build functioning applications. Working in teams helped us learn how to balance workloads, communicate effectively, and merge our coding styles.

#### 🔸 Time Management
The Pool is intense, with long hours and high expectations. Learning to manage our time effectively was key to keeping up with the workload and meeting deadlines. Balancing sleep, coding, and breaks was a constant challenge, but essential for survival!

## 📂 Projects

During the Pool, I worked on several projects that helped me develop a solid foundation in C. Below is a list of the projects from **Shell00** to **C07**, along with links to each project's folder:

## 🚀 Journey Since the Pool

After completing the Pool, I continued my education at 1337 and have been a full-time student for the past two years. Throughout this time, I've built on the skills I developed during the Pool, tackling more complex projects and deepening my understanding of programming.


Stay tuned for updates!
