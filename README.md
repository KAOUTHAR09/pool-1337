# 🏊‍♂️ 1337 Pool Projects

Welcome to my GitHub repository, where I've documented all the projects I completed during the **1337 Pool** two years ago. This was my first experience with coding, and it marked the beginning of my journey into the world of programming, specifically using the **C language**.

## 🌍 About the 1337 Pool

The **1337 Pool** is an intense, month-long coding bootcamp that serves as the entrance exam for [1337](https://1337.ma/), an innovative coding school in Morocco. Inspired by the École 42 model, the Pool is designed to test participants' resilience, problem-solving skills, and ability to learn quickly. During this period, we were introduced to fundamental programming concepts and worked on various challenging projects, all using the **C programming language**.

## 📂 Projects

During the Pool, I worked on several projects that helped me develop a solid foundation in C. Below is a list of the projects, along with brief descriptions and links to the respective code:

### 🟢 Project 1: s

This project served as an introduction to basic shell scripting  It was designed to familiarize participants with fundamental concepts and tools required for effective programming and system interaction. The focus was on developing essential skills in scripting, command-line operations. This foundational project was crucial in setting the stage for more advanced programming challenges and learning throughout the Pool.

## 🚀 Journey Since the Pool

After completing the Pool, I continued my education at 1337 and have been a full-time student for the past two years. Throughout this time, I've continued to build on the skills I developed during the Pool, taking on more complex projects and deepening my understanding of programming languages and concepts.

## 🛠️ What's Next?

In addition to this repository, I plan to create another repository where I’ll document all the projects I completed during the **common core** phase. This will include more advanced work, building on the foundation I established during the Pool.

Stay tuned for updates!

## 🙏 Acknowledgements

A big thank you to the 1337 community for their support and guidance throughout my journey.
